This is a repository with the various 3d models that I create.

Be careful downloading any gcode file as it could damage your printer permanently. The gcode files I produce are made for a Lulzbot Taz6 printer using single or dual extruders depending on the file, and I use a variety of materials so I would never recommend that you download any of them. They are there for my own reference as I sync this with my print server.
